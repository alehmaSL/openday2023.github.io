                    <li><h3>Unequal access to education and employment:</h3>women and girls often have limited access to education and training and fewer opportunities to gain employment and receive a wage. This reduces their economic power and can cause problems.</li>
                    <li><h3>Wage inequality:</h3>Women earn less than men doing the same work, even if they have the same qualifications and skills. This is called gender pay.</li>
                    <li><h3>Violence against women:</h3>Women and girls are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence, including domestic violence, rape and domestic violence.</li>
                    <li><h3>Gender:</h3>Gender characteristics can constrain people's perceptions and behaviors based on their gender. For example, women are expected to share family responsibilities along with their careers, while men tend to be strong, independent and unemotional.</li>

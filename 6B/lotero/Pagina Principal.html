      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Race inequality refers to the unequal treatment of people based on their race or ethnicity. It can be seen in many areas of society, including education, employment, housing, criminal justice, and healthcare.

There are many factors that contribute to race inequality, including historical discrimination, systemic racism, and individual biases. Historical discrimination has created a legacy of disadvantage for many racial and ethnic groups, while systemic racism continues to perpetuate inequalities in access to resources and opportunities. Individual biases can also lead to discriminatory practices, such as hiring discrimination or racial profiling.

        The effects of race inequality can be profound and long-lasting. People of color are more likely to live in poverty, to be unemployed or underemployed, to have lower levels of education, and to be in poorer health. They are also more likely to be incarcerated and to be victims of violence.

        Tackling race inequality requires a comprehensive approach that addresses historical discrimination, systemic racism, and individual biases.
Addressing historical discrimination involves reparations, ensuring past injustices are not repeated, and initiatives like affirmative action and community investments.
Eliminating systemic racism involves reforming policies in education, employment, housing, and criminal justice to dismantle discriminatory practices and promote equity.
Addressing individual biases involves unconscious bias training, promoting understanding and empathy, and creating opportunities for diverse interactions.

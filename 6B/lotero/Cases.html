        Redlining is the practice of denying loans or other financial services to people who live in certain neighborhoods, often because they are predominantly Black or Latino. Redlining can trap people in poverty and make it difficult for them to build wealth. Discrimination in employment; Black and Latino workers are more likely to be unemployed or underemployed than white workers, and they are also more likely to be paid less for the same work. These disparities in employment can make it difficult for people of color to afford a decent standard of living.
        Discrimination in housing; Black and Latino people are more likely to be denied mortgages or to be charged higher interest rates than white people. They are also more likely to live in neighborhoods with poor schools, high crime rates, and limited access to healthy food and other resources.

        Mass incarceration; The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, and Black and Latino people are disproportionately represented in the prison population. This is due in part to racial profiling, harsher sentencing for Black and Latino offenders, and the "war on drugs," which has disproportionately targeted people of color. Police brutality; Black and Latino people are more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested by police than white people. They are also more likely to be killed by police. This is due in part to racial profiling and the use of excessive force by police.

        Voter suppression; There are a number of ways in which people of color are suppressed from voting, including voter ID laws, gerrymandering, and cuts to polling places. These tactics are often used to disenfranchise Black and Latino voters, who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates.
        Discrimination in education; Black and Latino students are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school than white students, and they are also less likely to be placed in gifted and talented programs. These disparities in education can have a lasting impact on students' lives, making it more difficult for them to succeed in college and in the workforce.

        <h2>Definition:</h2>
        <p>Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions characterized by abnormal eating habits, a negative body image, and extreme preoccupation with food, weight, and shape. These disorders often have serious physical and psychological consequences and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Common types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder.</p>

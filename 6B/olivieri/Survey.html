        <h1>Welcome to the official SAD web page</h1>
        <p>SAD (Students Against Discrimination) is the latest web page created to fight against race inequality and gender discrimination in St Luke’s College, Argentina. Before talking about the main topics, we would like to introduce the principal co-founders of the web page. Francisco Barbeito, Leon Bottini, and Stefano Olivieri, are three of the most recognized students at St Luke's College, and together they decided to create SAD to spread awareness about these important issues in our community.</p>

        <h2>Main Problematics</h2>
        <p>Race Inequality is the unequal distribution of resources, power, and economic opportunity across race in a society. While the discussion of racial inequality, for example in the United States, is often focused on economic inequality, racial inequality also manifests itself in a multitude of ways that alone and together impact the well-being of all Americans. This includes racial disparities in wealth, education, employment, housing, mobility, health, rates of incarceration, and more.</p>
        <p>Gender Inequality is discrimination on the basis of sex or gender causing one sex or gender to be routinely privileged or prioritized over another.</p>

        <h2>How We Treat Gender Inequality at Our School</h2>
        <p>At St Luke's College, Gender Inequality and Race Inequality aren’t treated with specific measures as they actually don't take place at school or the few episodes that occurred didn’t end with dangerous or serious consequences. In the case of experimenting with any episode of Gender Inequality or Race Inequality, the zero tolerance of the school about these problematics won’t allow them to grow or continue to happen.</p>

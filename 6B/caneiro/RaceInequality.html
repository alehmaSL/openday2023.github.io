        <p>Race inequality is an unfortunate reality of human nature, it has been prevalent throughout human history in all shapes and forms. In the past, racial inequalities were far greater and tougher, slavery often comes to mind when thinking of this, but that’s fortunately not the case anymore, even if racial inequalities are still present in our modern and globalized world. Due to the developments in history, Europeans and those who share their descent are almost everywhere in more advantageous positions than natives or even mixed people. The Western European ethnic group are more often than not wealthier, better educated and sought after than other ethnic groups of darker colors or even Eastern Europeans themselves. This is both the case in Argentina and worldwide, especially in more ethnically diverse countries like the USA, where you can often find Afro-Americans or Central American communities in poverty. Other more important features of racial inequality is racism and systemic discrimination, be it intentionally or not.</p>

        <p>It’s a reality that our society has somewhat adopted racist thought into our culture, it may not be with the same connotation as in other countries but throwing words like “negro”, “chino” and even “yanqui” can come off as somewhat racist if not entirely, especially for an outsider who doesn’t comprehend those sayings. Be it a joke or not, the truth is that racism is deeply embedded into our cultural mindset and vocabulary, there are a lot of prejudices and stereotypes that are taken for granted, be it for the tone of their skin color or the place where they live. This should be changed because not only is it morally wrong to judge someone just on their physical appearance, be it from whoever it is, but it also shines a worrying image of Argentinian culture to outsiders, especially Westerners, who are WAY more sensitive on the subject than we are. We are all humans, doesn’t matter the race, color or anything else, we are one race, the Human race and we should be proud of those differences that stand us out, but we should also accept that we are, in fact, all equal and strive to reach an egalitarian society.</p>

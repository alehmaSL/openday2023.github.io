        <p>Unfortunately, there isn’t much that the school could do to fix this issues due to the almost homogenous makeup of the school, it being mostly composed of Western European descendants, if it were a more diverse pool of students and racist remarks were still rampant then there would be more direct actions available, but that’s not the case. The only real and viable solution to this problem is to raise the awareness of the students and staff at school about the very real case of race inequality, here in Argentina and in the world, this campaign to raise awareness could include posters preaching anti-racism, projects in collaboration with other schools or institutions that are “less fortunate”, as some would say, could help bind the students and the interactions between both groups would help lose certain prejudices. Lastly, if need be, racist jokes and discrimination of those who aren’t a part of the majority in the school could be penalized, although we think that crossing into the territory of jokes could become a violation of free speech, so we wouldn’t recommend this measure at all unless it’s a “final solution”.</p>

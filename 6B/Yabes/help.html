<p id="texto"> If a friend or relative has an eating disorder, such as anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder, you will probably want to do everything you can to help them recover.
    You're already doing a great job by finding out more about eating disorders and how to try to support them – it shows you care and helps you understand how they might be feeling.
    Getting professional help from a doctor, practice nurse, or a school or college nurse will give your friend or relative the best chance of getting better.
    But this can be one of the most difficult steps for someone living with an eating disorder, so try to encourage them to get help or offer to go along with them.

    <h2>You can support them by:</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="texto">Keep trying to include them</h3>

<div>
<p>  They may not want to go out or join in with activities, but keep trying to talk to them and ask them along, just like before. Even if they do not join in, they will still like to be asked. It will make them feel valued as a person. Be patient and compassionate. Recovery from an eating disorder takes time. Be patient, understanding that setbacks may occur. 


</p>
</div>
<br>
<h3 id="texto1">Try to build up their self-esteem  </h3>

<p>Perhaps by telling them what a great person they are, and how much you appreciate having them in your life and that you're happy to support them. Celebrate small victories and offer ongoing support and encouragement.  Encourage the person to express their feelings and experiences without judgment. Show empathy and validate their emotions, letting them know that you are there to support them. 


</p>
<br>
<h3 id="texto2">Give your time, listen to them and try not to give advice or criticism </h3>
<p> This can be tough when you do not agree with what they say about themselves and what they eat. Remember, you do not have to know all the answers. Just making sure they know you're there for them is what's important. This is especially true when it feels like your friend or relative is rejecting your friendship, help and support. Avoid making comments about their appearance or food choices that may trigger anxiety or shame.

 
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="texto3">Encourage professional help </h3>

<p>Encourage the individual to seek professional help from a healthcare provider, therapist, or eating disorder specialist. Offer to assist them in finding appropriate treatment options and accompany them to appointments if they are comfortable with it.

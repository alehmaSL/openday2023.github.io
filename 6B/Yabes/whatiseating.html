    <H1>¿What is an eating disorder?</H1>

    <p id="parrafo1">Eating disorders are serious mental health conditions that are characterized by abnormal eating behaviors and a distorted perception of one's body weight or shape. They can affect people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds, and can have severe physical and psychological consequences.
    Common types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa involves severe restriction of food intake, leading to significant weight loss and an intense fear of gaining weight. Bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise. Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurring episodes of consuming large quantities of food without control.

<p id="parrafo2">
    Eating disorders are complex and can be influenced by a combination of genetic, psychological, and sociocultural factors. They are not simply about food or weight, but often stem from underlying emotional issues, low self-esteem, perfectionism, or societal pressure to attain a certain body ideal.
The physical consequences of eating disorders can include malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, hormonal disturbances, organ damage, and even death. Psychological effects can include depression, anxiety, obsessive thoughts, and social isolation. Recovery from an eating disorder often requires a multidisciplinary approach, including medical, nutritional, and psychological support.

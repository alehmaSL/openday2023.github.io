<h2 id="texto1">1. Early Awareness:</h2>

<p> One of the first steps parents can take to help reduce the risk of eating disorders in their children is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of eating disorders. By familiarizing themselves with the statistics and factors that contribute to these disorders, parents can become better equipped to take timely and effective action. In the United States, it is particularly alarming to note that girls as young as age six start expressing concerns about their body image and weight. According to the National Eating Disorder Association, between 40 to 60 percent of girls aged six to 12 express concerns about "becoming too fat." These early signs indicate that eating disorders can manifest at a very young age, emphasizing the urgency of addressing this issue as early as possible.

<h2 id="texto1">2. Lead by Example: </h2>

<p>As parents, one of the most influential ways to shape your child's perception of themselves and their bodies is by providing a positive and healthy role model. Modeling healthy self-esteem and body image is crucial. This can be achieved by consistently showing respect for oneself and others, regardless of body shape or size. Encourage your child to value their accomplishments and character traits over their physical appearance, promoting self-worth that isn't solely tied to looks.
</p>
<br>
<h2 id="texto2">3. Avoid Diet Talk: </h2>
<p>Parents should refrain from discussing dieting and, ideally, avoid dieting themselves. Instead, focus on cultivating a lifestyle that prioritizes nutritious eating and regular exercise. It's essential to understand that research indicates that dieting is often counterproductive, as it can lead to feelings of deprivation and longing, ultimately resulting in binge eating. Encourage the family to embrace a balanced approach to food, where the emphasis is on nourishing the body rather than restricting certain foods. 
</p>
<br>
<h2 id="texto3">4. Seek Professional Help When Necessary: </h2>

<p>If you suspect that your child may be struggling with an eating disorder, it's vital not to attempt to make a diagnosis or provide treatment yourself. Early intervention by a qualified healthcare professional is one of the most effective ways to prevent an eating disorder from developing further or to halt its progression. These specialists are equipped with the knowledge and tools to assess and treat eating disorders in children, ensuring they receive the necessary support and care.

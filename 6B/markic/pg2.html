                    <h4>Anorexia Nervosa</h4>
                    Individuals with anorexia nervosa have an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. They severely restrict their food intake, leading to significant weight loss. People with anorexia often have a relentless pursuit of thinness, even when they are underweight. They may also engage in excessive exercise and have a preoccupation with food and calorie counting.

                    <h4>Bulimia Nervosa</h4>
                    Bulimia nervosa is characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating, followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise. People with bulimia may have a normal weight or may fluctuate between weight gain and loss.

                    <h4>Binge Eating Disorder</h4>
                    This disorder involves recurrent episodes of consuming large quantities of food in a short period, often accompanied by a feeling of loss of control. Unlike bulimia, individuals with binge eating disorder do not engage in compensatory behaviors to counteract the excessive eating. They may experience guilt, shame, and distress related to their eating habits.

                    <h4>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)</h4>
                    ARFID is characterized by an avoidance or restriction of food intake that leads to inadequate nutrition and weight loss or failure to achieve expected weight gain in children. Unlike anorexia nervosa, individuals with ARFID may not have body image concerns, but they avoid certain foods or food groups based on sensory issues, aversions, or fear of negative consequences.

<h4> Orthorexia</h4>
Refers to an unhealthy obsession with eating “pure” food. Food considered “pure” or “impure” can vary from person to person. This doesn't mean that anyone who subscribes to a healthy eating plan or diet is suffering from orthorexia.

                    <h4>OSFED</h4>
                    Stands for 'other specified feeding or eating disorder'. People with OSFED have symptoms that are similar to one or more eating disorders, but may not meet all the criteria for these conditions. 'Other' eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder.

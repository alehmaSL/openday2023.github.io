<p>We invite all high school students at St. Luke's college to participate in a survey in which we talk and raise awareness about eating problems. We obtained a total of 50 responses, where we found people of different ages and genders, with different personalities and each one with their own experience. All the answers helped us to reach different conclusions and to be able to analyze the way in which these problems affect the lives of people, who are also, in this case, close to us. To protect the privacy of the students, we decided to do this survey anonymously. Which made many more people able to participate and be encouraged to tell what they knew, thought or happened.</p>

<h4>Here we are going to provide images of the responses:</h4>

<P>In this first three questions of the survey we can see that we had responses from people from ages 11 to 18, from first year of secondary school to sixth year, with 6th year, with 24%, being the ones who participated the most, and that it was mainly women who participated in the survey. Regarding age we had a very wide range but the same did not happen with gender since there were more women who were able to help with the answers</P>

<P>Luckily, in our survey the vast majority seem to know and be informed about eating problems. A total of 90% answered that they were on the topic, although some more and others less, since half of those who voted that they knew about this did not vote to be fully informed, it is good that they know something and can understand from such an early age what it covers the problem.<P>

<P>Only 18.4% suffered an ED. Of the 50 people who responded there would be approximately 9 or 8 people, something positive since it is a relatively low number. As for those who suffered, there was a half who still have not overcome it and a part of those who suffered have already improved and despite it being something that accompanies you for life, these people who are already better were able to overcome it in periods of 2 to 4 years . It is a difficult process so many people suffer from these problems all their lives, it is good to move forward little by little and be able to recognize it. Unfortunately none of those who suffered were able to speak and get medical help. Most of them decided not to share it with anyone and the others simply talked about it with their friends or family. It is also understandable that it is difficult for someone to tell it, it is not something easy nor does it have an instant solution, which is why it causes fear in those who suffer from it and many times they do not believe that they can improve with the help of another.</P>

<p>More than half of those surveyed told us that they know at least less than 5 people who suffer from it. Unfortunately, only 16% said they did not know anyone with ED. This tells us that although it may not seem like it or we may not know it, many people close to us or known to us are probably suffering from an eating problem. The number is very large, and although adolescence is the most repetitive age in which these problems occur, the numbers and the amount of people who suffer from this never cease to surprise. Many of our respondents were able to help their friends/family and even if they think that they are not always able to help them with ED, for the simple fact that they continue to fight against it, someone who listens to you and talks to you is always a great help. By this we mean that the fact of being there helps and we are not only helping correctly if the person manages to combat the disease.</p>

<p>In these last two questions we sought to see what they thought could increase the number of people with ED. Especially in these last generations, social networks have taken on great importance and we wanted to know if they really affected them, since many models are shown who have a "hegemonic" body and this can cause many insecurities in those who look at them on the other side of the screen. Just as we had imagined the result, I affirm that many times these images that they show of the "perfect" girls end up causing insecurities in those who are looking at them that often end in an ED. Afterwards, we also wanted to find out if the fact of relating to someone who suffers from eating problems could lead you to fall into that struggle too. It was a much more divided vote than the previous one, for some yes and for others no. There was also a smaller part, 10%, who would have gone through this situation. But all this is something much more personal and also has to do with who you are and your personality.</p>

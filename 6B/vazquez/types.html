    <p> In many regions, girls and women continue to face barriers to education, including limited access, cultural biases, early marriage, and gender-based violence. This leads to lower literacy rates and restricted opportunities for personal development and economic advancement.

    <p>Women often bear the disproportionate burden of unpaid care work, including household chores, caregiving for children, the elderly, and family members. This imbalance limits women's time for education, employment, and other pursuits outside the home.

    <p>Women and girls experience disproportionately high rates of violence, including domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking, and harmful practices like female genital mutilation. These forms of violence perpetuate gender inequality and hinder women's physical and psychological well-being.

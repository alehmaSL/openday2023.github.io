    <h2>Bulimia</h2>
    <p>Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive food intake, followed by compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, excessive use of laxatives, or extreme physical exercise. Like anorexia, bulimia can have serious physical and mental health implications.

    <h3>Causes</h3>>
    The causes of bulimia are similar to those of other eating disorders and also involve a combination of biological, psychological and social factors. Social pressure to meet unrealistic beauty standards, low self-esteem, body image dissatisfaction, and underlying emotional problems can contribute to the development of bulimia. Genetic factors and serotonin disorders have also been associated with this disorder.
        
     <h3>Consequences</h3>>
     Bulimia can have serious health consequences. On a physical level, frequent episodes of binge eating and purging can cause electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal problems, tooth damage due to stomach acid, and heart problems. On a psychological level, bulimia can lead to anxiety, depression, shame and guilt, creating a destructive cycle that can be difficult to break.
        
       <h3>Treatments</h3>>
       Bulimia treatment usually involves a combination of psychological therapy, medical care, and nutritional support. Cognitive behavioral therapy is commonly used to address negative thought patterns and dysfunctional eating behaviors. Interpersonal therapy and behavioral dialect therapy may also be effective.
        
       Recovery from bulimia is a gradual process that requires time, patience, and commitment. With the right support, many people can overcome bulimia and learn to manage their emotions and eating behaviors in a healthy way.</p>

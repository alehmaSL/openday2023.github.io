     <h2>Anorexia</h2>
     <p> Anorexia is an eating disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake and an obsessive concern about body weight and shape. This disease can have serious consequences for the physical and mental health of those who suffer from it.

    <h3>Causes:</h3>
    The causes of anorexia are complex and multifactorial, involving biological, psychological and social factors. Some risk factors include genetic predisposition, social pressure to meet unrealistic beauty standards, psychological trauma, anxiety disorders, and low self-esteem. Modern society, with its emphasis on thinness as a beauty ideal, may also contribute to the development of anorexia.
        
        <h3>Consequences:</h3>
        The consequences of anorexia can be devastating both physically and psychologically. On a physical level, a lack of essential nutrients can lead to malnutrition, affecting vital organs and bodily functions. Health problems can include muscle weakness, osteoporosis, heart disorders, damage to the digestive system, and hormonal problems. On a psychological level, anorexia can cause depression, anxiety, social isolation and, in extreme cases, suicidal thoughts.
        
        <h3>Treatments:</h3>
        Treatment of anorexia generally involves a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the physical and psychological aspects of the disorder. Cognitive behavioral therapy is commonly used to address negative thinking patterns and encourage changes in eating behavior. Family therapy can also be crucial, as anorexia often affects the entire family system.
        
        Medical care is essential to restore physical health through nutritional monitoring and, in severe cases, hospitalization. Mental health professionals and nutritionists work together to help the individual establish a healthier relationship with food and their body.
        
        It is important to highlight that the treatment must be personalized, adapting to the individual needs of each person. Recovery from anorexia can take time and effort, but with the right support, many people are able to overcome this disorder and lead healthy, fulfilling lives.</p>

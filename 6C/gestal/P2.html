      <h2>Forms Results</h2>
      
      <h4>We have conducted a survey in our school for students and teachers to find out what they know about eating disorders. 
        We had 48 responses ranging in ages from 13 to 59.
        </h4>

      <p>First we asked if they knew what eating disorders are. 93.8% knew what they were. Only 6.3% didn’t know what eating disorders were. 
        Then we asked what disorders they knew about. The most known about were Anorexia in first place, Bulimia in second place, and binge eating in third. Vigorexia, Ortorexia, Anorexia Nerviosa, and Obesity weren’t so well known and only had one or two people. 
        83.3% of our responses knew about someone who is suffering or has suffered these types of disorders. 10.4% didn’t know anybody and 6% may know somebody. The people they knew had this issue were either friends, sisters, and students. When asked if this person they knew received help 73.3% did, 11,1% didn’t and 15.6% didn’t know if they did. 
        When asked if they considered they have suffered or were suffering of an eating disorder 72.9% didn’t, 20,8% may have and 4,2% have. If you did, we asked if they told someone. 92% answered no and only 8% answered yes.
        Lastly we asked if they know how they could help someone with an eating disorder. The answered varied, but mostly said to talk to them, tell their family and support them so they see a professional. Many didn’t know how to help, but said that they think it is important to know how and would like to be aware. </p>

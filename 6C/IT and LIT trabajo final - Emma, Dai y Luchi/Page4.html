            <h4>Sanna Legan talks about eating disorders and the illusion of control- TEDx Talk</h4>
            <p>If you have an eating disorder, you aren't in control. Even if you believe you can handle it, it will most likely get worse progressively, so you should get help as soon as possible</p>

            <h4>People who had eating disorders talk about how disorders are ignored if someone doesn't look like they have one</h4>
            <p>It's impossible to know who is suffering from an eating disorder, many times it isn't visible for others, so you shouldn't comment on others or assume how their relationship to food is. And it's important to listen if someone says they are struggling, even if you can't see it.</p>

            <h4>How were this people affected by their eating disorders</h4>
            <p>Eating disorders don't only affect your weight. Serious problems come with them. The lack of nutrients makes your brain work bad. And the obsession makes food and guilt be the center of your life. It's a constant suffering for the person who is going through it, and the people around them. It causes isolation, anger and pain.</p>

            <h4>Andrea's testimony, how she identified and overcame her eating disorder</h4>
            <p>Andrea struggled with an eating disorder since a very young age. She had a complicated family situation and struggled for years, it took her too long to realize what was happening. It's important to raise awareness about this, so you can identify if someone close to you is going through this, or if you are, because it causes mental pain and damages you physically too.</p>

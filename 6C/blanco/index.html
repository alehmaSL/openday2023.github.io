            <h1> Definition and characteristics</h1>
        <p> </p>Eating disorders are mental health conditions marked by unhealthy eating behaviors affecting physical and mental well-being. Anorexia nervosa involves self-imposed starvation, bulimia nervosa includes binge eating followed by purging, and binge-eating disorder centers on frequent overeating. These disorders often stem from distorted body image and can lead to serious health complications. Treatment involves psychotherapy, nutritional counseling, and sometimes medication. Early intervention is crucial for recovery, as untreated cases can have life-threatening consequences.

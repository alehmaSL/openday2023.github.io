        <p id="p2pag">The exact causes of anorexia are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a complex interplay of various factors, including biological, psychological, and environmental influences.</p>
        <div id="cont2pag">
            <ul>
                <li>Body image concerns: Distorted body image and dissatisfaction with one's appearance play a significant role. Society's stereotypes do not help at all.</li>
                <li>Perfectionism: People with anorexia often have perfectionistic tendencies and set unrealistically high standards for themselves, including in terms of body weight and shape.</li>
                <li>Low self-esteem: Low self-esteem and a lack of self-worth can contribute to anorexic behaviors as individuals seek a sense of control and achievement through weight loss.</li>
                <li>Peer pressure: Social and peer influences, such as comments or comparisons with friends, can play a role in the development of disordered eating habits.</li>
            </ul>

        <p id="p2pag">Not only does anorexia create short term consequences but long term ones too, affecting both the physical and psychological aspect.</p>
    <div id="cont2pag">
        <ul>
            <li>Weakness and fatigue: Inadequate nutrition can lead to muscle wasting and weakness, making physical activities difficult.</li>
            <li>Growth and hormonal disturbances: In adolescents, anorexia can disrupt normal growth and development, including delayed or irregular menstruation and reduced bone growth.</li>
            <li>Depression and anxiety: Anorexia is often accompanied by depression and anxiety, which can become more severe as the disorder progresses.</li>
            <li>Obsession with food and body image: Individuals with anorexia often become preoccupied with thoughts about food, weight, and body image, which can interfere with daily life, also leading to social isolation.</li>
            <li>Mortality: Anorexia nervosa has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder, with complications such as cardiac arrest or organ failure being the leading causes of death.</li>

<H1>What is Anorexia?</H1>

<p id="parrafo1">Anorexia is a serious and potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. Anorexic individuals have a distorted perception of their own bodies, often seeing themselves as overweight, even when they are not. Victims of this eating  disorder typically engage in extreme dietary restrictions, leading to significant weight loss and malnutrition. They may also show negative behaviors such as excessive exercise, self-induced vomiting, and the misuse of laxatives. </p>
